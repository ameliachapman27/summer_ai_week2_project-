In this file, write a short reflection on how this assignment went for you, any challenges you faced, and what strategies or resources you used to overcome any difficulties.

This assignment went okay for me. I conceptually understood how the algorithm worked (like why you would use a stack for depth first search and a queue for breadth first search, for example), but I was having trouble understanding how to translate it into the actual working code. Part of the problem is that functions such as getStartState and getSuccessors did not have any code in them in the search.py file and I wasn't aware that it was in one of the different files (I thought that I actually had to write code for that which we didn't learn how to do). I overcame the problems that I faced by asking for help (going to office hours). This way I can get someone to actually explain the concept for me instead of just giving me the code like googling it would.
